point and plane
===============

determine on which side of a plane a point lies.
determine on which side of a plane (0,0,-1000000) is.
if both are on the same side, return 1
if both are on oposite side, return -1


much simpler math here, than in point_on_plane.txt, 
but we cannot tell, if we are out of bounds, and just 
performed a useless test.
