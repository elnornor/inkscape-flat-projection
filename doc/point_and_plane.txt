point and plane
===============

determine on which side of a plane a point lies.
determine on which side of a plane (0,0,-1000000) is.
if both are on the same side, return 1
if both are on oposite side, return -1


much simpler math here, than in point_on_plane.txt, 
but we cannot tell, if we are out of bound.

We have planes that can possibly intersect.
E.g. the side of a window can be extended to pierce the roof.
If test points from the roof are compared with the window side, 
we may get results on either side, spoiling this possible shortcut.

we need to know of we are out of bounds.
